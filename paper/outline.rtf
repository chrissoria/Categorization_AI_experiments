\\section*\{CAN AI REPLACE HUMAN CODERS FOR SOCIAL SCIENCE CATEGORIZATION?\}\
\
\\subsection*\{Basic Idea of the Paper\}\
Utilize open-ended survey responses to:\
\\begin\{enumerate\}\
    \\item Establish a descriptive framework of how effectively Large Language Models (LLMs) categorize these responses compared to traditional methods.\
    \\item Contrast the accuracy and efficiency of LLMs with human coders in the categorization process.\
    \\item Analyze how the effectiveness of LLMs varies depending on factors such as the complexity of survey questions, language nuances, length of response, and the model's training data.\
    \\item Extract best practices from both LLM and human categorization techniques to propose an optimal hybrid approach.\
\\end\{enumerate\}\
Conclude with broader implications for the future use of LLMs in qualitative data analysis and the potential for enhancing their categorization capabilities.\
\
\\subsection*\{Sequence of Analysis\}\
\\begin\{enumerate\}\
    \\item \\textbf\{Technique Evaluation:\} Employ various categorization techniques with the AI on the open-ended survey data, subsequently analyzing and distinguishing the most effective methods.\
    \\item \\textbf\{Response Analysis:\} Delve into the categorized data to pinpoint which responses the AI has accurately categorized and which it struggled with, providing a comprehensive overview of its performance.\
    \\item \\textbf\{Survey Design Recommendations:\} Based on the results of the response analysis, formulate actionable recommendations for the future design of open-ended survey questions to optimize categorization efficacy.\
    \\item \\textbf\{Package Development and Publication:\} Construct and release a Python package encapsulating all the efficacious techniques identified, streamlining the process for future applications and offering an accessible tool for researchers and developers.\
